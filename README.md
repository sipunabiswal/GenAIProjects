ðŸ¤– AI Agents and Their Types
1. What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is an intelligent entity that perceives its environment, reasons about the situation, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike simple agents, AI agents use techniques from artificial intelligence such as search, planning, learning, and reasoning to make better decisions.

Core Characteristics of AI Agents:

Autonomy: Operates independently without constant human input.

Adaptability: Learns and improves from experiences.

Proactiveness: Acts toward achieving goals, not just reacting.

Rationality: Chooses the best possible action based on knowledge.

Social ability: Communicates with humans or other agents.
